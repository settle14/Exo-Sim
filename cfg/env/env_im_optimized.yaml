# Optimized reward configuration
reward_specs:
  "k_pos": 200      # Much higher position reward
  "k_vel": 5       # Much higher velocity reward  
  "k_energy": 0.05  # Lower energy penalty to encourage movement
  
  "w_pos": 0.6      # Higher position weight
  "w_vel": 0.2     # Velocity weight
  "w_upright": 0.1 # Lower upright weight (since it was already good)
  "w_energy": 0.1   # Remove energy penalty completely

#### Task Configs
resampling_interval: 100    # More frequent resampling
termination_distance: 0.5  # Stricter termination for better learning
